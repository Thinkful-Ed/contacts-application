# Contacts application example

### TO DO

[ ] Make sure there are no duplicate names added to the array of objects or `contactsList`.
[ ] Use JavaScript `forEach` to iterate through the list of contacts and display them below the form. Refer to example on the Thinkful page.
[ ] Add other necessary fields and buttons.
[ ] You do not need to include "Add phone number" button. It is optional.
[ ] Improve styles if you wish.
